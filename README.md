Banana Music App
Welcome to Banana Music - your fun time-pass music app!

Overview
This project was created as part of the WEB222 course.
It's a simple web application that mimics the interface of popular music 
streaming apps like Spotify or Apple Music. Please note that Banana Music 
does not play actual music; it was designed to help students get familiar 
with the basics of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
